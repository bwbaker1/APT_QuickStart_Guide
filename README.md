# Algorithm Publication Tool (APT) Quick Start Guide

## Getting Started in APT by Signing Up and Creating a Document

## 1. Introduction
The Algorithm Publication Tool (APT) is a cloud-based publication tool developed within NASA’s Earth Science Data Systems (ESDS) program that standardizes Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) content, streamlines the authoring process of ATBDs, and allows the science community to search and retrieve ATBDs from a centralized repository.
Users can create an ATBD within the APT user interface or use one of the provided ATBD templates to create their document (e.g., Google Docs, Microsoft Word, or LaTeX; see [APT User Guide] and APT Template User Guide). Both options require an APT account. 

## 2. Getting Started

This quick start guide shows how to sign up for an account and how to create an ATBD. 

### 2.1 Create an Account

Follow these steps to create an account.

**Sign up for an APT account and sign in**

1. Navigate to [https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/apt/]
2. Click on sign in in the upper right corner (Figure 1)

![Figure 1](https://github.com/bwbaker1/APT_QuickStart_Figures/blob/main/QS_Figure1_LandingPage.png?raw=true "Figure 1. APT landing page. The sign in button is shown in the red box.")

3. Click on sign up (Figure 2)

![Figure 2](https://github.com/bwbaker1/APT_QuickStart_Figures/blob/main/QS_Figure2_SignInPage.png?raw=true "Figure 2. To create an APT account, click on sign up from the sign in window (red box).")

4. Enter your information to create an account (Figure 3).

![Figure 3](https://github.com/bwbaker1/APT_QuickStart_Figures/blob/main/QS_Figure3_SignUp.png?raw=true "Figure 3. Account creation window. Enter your email, preferred username, and password (red box).")

   - **Email** -- Enter the full email address that will be associated with the new APT account.
   - **Preferred username** -- Enter the preferred username for the account.
   - **Password** – Enter a strong password for signing into your APT account. Note: the password must contain at least one lower-case letter, upper-case letter, special character, number, and must be at least 8 characters long.
   - **Sign up** – ​Click this button to create the new account. If you already have an account, you can click on the sign in text below the box (item 4 in Figure 5).
   - Verify your email when prompted.

   - You will receive an email when your account is approved.
   Set-up Multi-factor authentication (MFA, Figure 5). APT uses Multi-factor authentication (MFA) and is required to sign in. This is an authentication method that requires a user to provide two or more forms of identification to gain access to the tool. MFA enhances security, keeping your data safe. Any authenticator application that generates time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) should work for authorization, such as Google Authenticator, Authy, DUO, Microsoft Authenticator, or similar. 
   
![Figure 5](https://github.com/bwbaker1/APT_QuickStart_Figures/blob/main/QS_Figure5_MFA.png?raw=true "On your first sign into APT, you will be prompted to set up MFA. Use the provided code or QR to set up MFA (red box).")

   - Use your MFA authenticator application to enter a one-time password (OTP, Figure 6).
      
![Figure 6](https://github.com/bwbaker1/APT_QuickStart_Figures/blob/main/QS_FIgure6_OTP.png?raw=true "Upon each sign in attempt, you must use your MFA authenticator to generate a one time password (red box).")      
   - Click “confirm” to sign in. You should now see your user dashboard (Figure 7).      
      
### 2.2 Create an ATBD   

Decide whether you want to use the APT interface or a template (not sure which is right for you? Read about the benefits and drawbacks of each [here](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/apt/new-atbd).)

Use APT authoring environment

   - From your user dashboard, click on create to start a new ATBD (Figure 7).

![Figure 7](https://github.com/bwbaker1/APT_QuickStart_Figures/blob/main/QS_Figure7_UserDashboard.png?raw=true "Once signed in, you will be navigated to your user dashboard. To create a new ATBD, click on create (red box).")  

   - You will be prompted with the welcome to your new document pop-up window. This window explains the different stages of creating an ATBD in APT. Click “understood” to begin your new document (Figure 8).

![Figure 8](https://github.com/bwbaker1/APT_QuickStart_Figures/blob/main/QS_Figure8_newDocumentWelcome.png?raw=true "Prompt that appears when a user creates a new ATBD. Users must indicate they understand the content shown on the page in order to continue (red box).")

   - Give your ATBD a title. Continue adding content (see the [User Guide](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/apt/user-guide) for more details). See section 2.3 to learn how to add collaborators.
